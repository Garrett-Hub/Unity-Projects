# Unity-Projects
A collection of projects that I've worked on for the Unity Engine

### [Navigation System](/Navigation-System/)
This is a system I am working on to display different forms of navigation HUD elements.  It uses a custom object pool to keep track of different types of waypoint marker HUD elements for the different systems.

### [Extensions](/Extensions/)
A collection of useful extensions for use in the Unity Engine.
